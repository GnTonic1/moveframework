#summary We will publish information about the development here.

= Developing version 3.0 =
*2012-04-05*
 * The whole architecture was redefined. It is now almost like in the class diagram.
 * New advanced synchronizing class (MoveLock)
 * New classes for the planned features
 * Mask added for each ball, the ball algorithm will be not binary any more

*2012-04-04*
 * Yeah, the big and unnecessary opengl math library was removed and replaced with my own math library
 * Only a small part of include files are published now
 * The precompiled headers were removed, so you don't have to include all the MoveFramework includes in your project, only what you need. :) This will make the library more portable.

= Initial class diagram for version 3.0 =
I made a UML class diagram, so everybody can see what's going on in the code. The classes above the thick line can be seen from outside of the dll.
