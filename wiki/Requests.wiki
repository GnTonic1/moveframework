#summary Requests for new features

*Please comment if you have a request. Also do so, if the request is already in the list, I want to add features, that are needed by more.*

= Requests =
 * Navigation controller support
   * I got a controller. :) Started the work with it, but it seems the same pairing process will not work with the navi controller. Anyone else could connect it? (You can pair the device with MotionInJoy, than remove MIJ and you can try to connect to the native BT stack just like the Move.)
 * MotionInJoy support
   * Some of you could not pair with the native stack, so my framework will work with both the native stack and MIJ.
 * Joystick and mouse emulation
   * You are not a programmer? No problem, just play your favorite games with the MoveFramework. ;)

= Fulfilled requests =
 * C# support
 * The framework works without a camera
 * Expose the the control of colors

= Requests that will not be realized =
 * Support for other webcams
   * The algorithm is optimized for the Eye, plus other webcams may not give the same control. So it would be really hard to support other webcams. The Eye is not expensive though. Not at all.
 * OSC support
    * Sorry, I don't know OSC and I don't intend to do so. But feel free to make an OSC wrapper.
