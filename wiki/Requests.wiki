#summary Requests for new features

*Please comment if you have a request. Also do so, if the request is already in the list, I want to add features, that are needed by more.*

= Requests =
 * Navigation controller support
    * I don't have a navigation controller. If I get one from somebody, I will get it work with the framework. Otherwise I can't.

= Fulfilled requests =
 * C# support
 * The framework works without a camera
 * Expose the the control of colors

= Requests that will not be realized =
 * Support for other webcams
   * The algorithm is optimized for the Eye, plus other webcams may not give the same control. So it would be really hard to support other webcams. The Eye is not expensive though. Not at all.
 * OSC support
    * Sorry, I don't know OSC and I don't intend to do so. But feel free to make an OSC wrapper.
