#summary Requests for new features

*Please comment if you have a request. Also do so, if the request is already in the list, I want to add features, that are needed by more.*

= Requests =
 * Navigation controller support
    * I don't have a navigation controller. If I get one from somebody, I will get it work with the framework. Otherwise I can't test.
 * Support for other webcams
    * I can make it work, but the PS Eye is a very good webcam, the accuracy may be not this good with other webcams
    * This is not my priority, there are more important changes first
 * OSC support
    * Sorry, I don't know OSC and I don't intend to do so. But feel free to make an OSC wrapper.

= Fulfilled requests =
 * C# support
 * The framework works without a camera
