=Instructions to pair and connect the Moves to a Windows based computer=

==Seting the Bluetooth address of your dongle in the Move's memory (pairing)==
The Move connects always to the host address, that is stored in the it's memory. So if you pair it with a host, several other hosts can be around, the Move will ignore them.
  # Make sure MotionInJoy is not installed (or removed properly)
  # Connect your Move to the PC via USB (you can connect more at once, all will be paired)
  # Start the Calibration Tool, and press P to pair all devices.
    * If you have more BT dongles, all Moves will be paired to the first dongle found.


==Connecting the paired Moves to your PC the first time==
*Only tested with Windows 8, please comment if it works or not with other versions!*
